Python (3.x) Bindings to the Guild Wars 2 Spidy API
=============================================

This small Python module provides easy-to-use bindings to the Guild Wars 2 Spidy API. This fork was created to update the original repository by Tynril to use Python 3 rather than Python 2.

What is Guild Wars 2 Spidy?
---------------------------

[Guild Wars 2 Spidy](http://www.gw2spidy.com) is a fan-made website that allows browsing the Black Lion Trading Post, which is the trading market of the Guild Wars 2 game. Its [API](https://github.com/rubensayshi/gw2spidy/wiki/API-v0.9) allow to programatically access this data. Note that the data being accessed is the one fetched by Gw2Spidy, and not directly the one on ArenaNet's servers.

How to use it?
--------------

Simply put the `gw2spidy.py` module somewhere in your project, and import it with `from gw2spidy import Gw2Spidy`. You can then use the static methods of the `Gw2Spidy` class.
